• This project marked my first venture outside of classroom assignments.
• I undertook the development for a close friend's company.
• Striving for consistency, I emulated the design of the old website.
• Placeholder "Lorem Ipsum" text was used until actual information became available.
• Bootstrap was incorporated to enhance structural elements.
• A JavaScript-based slideshow was implemented for visual appeal.
• While attempting a navigation button with jQuery, it became less intuitive.
• Ultimately, I opted for Bootstrap to craft a more user-friendly mobile navigation button.
• Recognizing the importance of streamlined navigation, I consolidated all pages into one for an improved user experience.
• Leveraging my Photoshop skills, I converted images to JPG format to enhance accessibility and reduce file sizes, subsequently improving load times.
